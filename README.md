  1. Imported the img with relative path, so if anyone downloaded it should change the path in 
     
     ```### initialize and setup for the games > # IMG```
  
  2. New features are being able to shoot the Ramen to Ayus, and get the points A, and if get hit by Ayu, will get the points B
    
     And the Ramen will randomly shot by the Player if u press spacebar.
